                <p>Hello family and friends,</p>
<p>Happy New Year 2022!</p>
<p>After what seemed like a never-ending, pandemic-dominated 2020, we had a taste of some degree of normalcy in the year 2021. At the present time, the pandemic is still raging, and we sincerely hope that you stay healthy and safe in the year ahead.</p>
<p>Ethan and Luke returned to in-person school in March 2021 after nearly an entire year of remote-learning. We remember vividly the day they returned to school.  They were finally able to meet some of their classmates in-person.</p>
<img alt="kids-back-at-school" class="align-center" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7269845/148726576-35a80ba3-f659-4bdc-a9e8-b1ec025cb9c5.jpg" style="width: 500px;" />
<p>We also resumed traveling  this year. We traveled to New York and Maryland in May; in New York, we hung out with Lawrence's family (and Ethan and Luke got to play with their cousins for the first time in two years); in Maryland, we met with our friends and neighbors, and Ethan also had an opportunity to play in a soccer tournament with his soccer team.</p>
<img alt="tzuang-family" class="align-center" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7269845/148727040-cf109f3b-946a-4603-9d5a-d7033e29b5c9.jpg" style="width: 500px;" />
<img alt="asa-lions" class="align-center" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7269845/148727220-884ac40d-4f45-437a-8bcc-db1733eca4c5.jpg" style="width: 500px;" />
<p>Putting icing on the cake, at the end of the trip, we got a tour of the cockpit during our transfer flight - Ethan and Luke were beyond excited!</p>
<img alt="flight-cockpit" class="align-center" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7269845/148727395-15c6f97a-0622-4a98-b352-b52b33d6f5b4.jpg" style="width: 375px;" />
<p>We spent Thanksgiving week with friends and family in Seattle and Portland. Visiting Seattle, a city that Marian and I studied for a year in undergrad, brought back a lot of memories. It was great to see my cousin and her family in Portland too! On our way back, we took a detour to Redwood National Parks where we were greeted with rare sunny weather during that time of the year.</p>
<img alt="univ-washington-quad" class="align-center" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7269845/148727682-ae011a3c-8b23-4c8f-afef-387bba7b3539.jpg" style="width: 500px;" />
<img alt="redwoods-national-park" class="align-center" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7269845/148728129-0dce388e-23e7-46a2-afd2-b244f640d254.jpg" style="width: 375px;" />
<p>We wrapped up the year with a trip to Southern California in the week leading up to Christmas. We had a blast!</p>
<img alt="redwoods-national-park" class="align-center" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7269845/148728395-b67cb082-eb91-44b1-9e8e-1ae725acdd15.jpg" style="width: 500px;" />
<p>In the fall, Ethan began his first year at middle school as a six-grader and Luke's a third-grader. Both of them really enjoyed the in-person instructions where they get to hang out with classmates in real life; many of the classmates live in the same neighborhoods as we do, so they get to play with them after classes too!</p>
<p>In terms of extracurricular activities, both Ethan and Luke resumed their soccer seasons after a one-year hiatus. This is the first time that they play with their respective teams in California since they joined the team in August of 2020; it took the teammates some time to gel with one another, but we can tell that both of them have developed as a player this year. We are thankful that both of them got a lot of opportunities to guest with teams that are one year older from time to time, so they get ample challenges too.</p>
<p>As the season progressed, their soccer games and tournaments also took us to places that are pretty far from home. So far, we have spent one weekend in Las Vegas, another weekend in Lake Tahoe, a weekend in Sacramento, and numerous weekends in the Stockton area. We look forward to traveling with them for more of their soccer games this year!</p>

<img alt="luke-soccer" class="align-center" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7269845/148730316-d33718a5-3f9d-42e8-a337-80781554349b.jpg" style="width: 375px;" />
<p>Marian had a busy year at UCSF where she helped launch a few projects and wrote some papers and grant applications (which hopefully some of them will be funded!). Her research areas center around addressing Asian American health disparities, with a particular focus on Alzheimer's disease and dementia. She was a speaker at several community talks where she presented in Mandarin, and is looking forward to more collaborations with community partners in the year ahead.</p>
<p>I-Kang's job at KoBold Metals is proceeding at an exciting pace too. His team's project is focused on exploration for Nickel, Copper and Cobalt in Northern Quebec, and both the company and the project has been profiled by top tier outlets such as MIT Technology Review (<a class="reference external" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vczHoJRWwMExQSz7U3S4f0nN40hwc4OD/view?usp=sharing">The big tech quest to find the metals needed for the energy overhaul</a>) and Bloomberg BusinessWeek (<a class="reference external" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oeSyVpwQ5RaXF5d3v3AGtoAC87k00tYJ/view?usp=sharing">The Energy Future Needs Cleaner Batteries</a>) in the past year. The exploration program will continue this summer, and - who knows, maybe he will get to visit the field program in Kangiqsujuaq?</p>

<p>Our warmest wishes to you all for a healthy, happy and prosperous new year.</p>
